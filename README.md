# CryptoProtocol_CourseProject
As a result of the course work, a software application for secure interaction over a network was developed using a combined protection method - encryption of keys with the RSA algorithm, encryption of messages with the RCA algorithm, SHA-512 hashing and RSA digital signature. This cryptographic information protection tool is implemented in the C # programming language and uses the Crypto API Next Generation of the Windows operating system. The developed software has a client-server architecture and operates on the basis of the TCP protocol.
